# Data-exploration-of-vehicle-sales-using-R 

The Sample Sales Data has 2,823 rows of data (=orders) on 25 variables. Each row represents an order and the STATUS column has details about the order. The data has columns titled: QUANTITY ORDERED, PRICE EACH and SALES. You can verify that QUANTITY ORDERED multiplied by PRICE EACH would give you the SALES. As no units are available, you may assume that PRICE EACH and SALES and in thousands of dollars. 

we are trying to answer the following Question in this project: 

(a). How many unique ORDERNUMBER values are in the data? 

(b). How many unique CUSTOMERNAME values are in the data? 

(c). In a table summarize the number and percentage of the values of the column title STATUS. Visualize this information via a Pie-Chart and also via a bar chart.

(d). In a table list the top five CUSTOMERNAME who had the most number of orders “Shipped”. For each, also provide information on what percentage of their total orders 
have “Shipped”. Visualize this information via a bar chart.

(e). In a table list the top five CUSTOMERNAME who had the most number of PRODUCTLINE= 'Motorcycles' Shipped. You would need the in formation column titled QUANTITYORDERED for this. The part d above does not take into account the quantity of the motorcycles in each order. Visualize this information via a bar chart.

(f). How many of the total 2,823 orders had STATUS value “Cancell”? Which CUSTOMERNAME had the most number of orders with STATUS value “Cancell”?

(g). In a table summarize the number and percentage of the values of the column title PRODUCTLINE. Visualize this information via a Pie-Chart and also via a bar chart.

(h). In a table summarize the number and percentage of the values of the column title PRODUCTLINE for which the STATUS value “Shipped”. Visualize this information via a Pie-Chart and also via a bar chart. Compare with your answer in part (g) above.

(Q2). What is the maximum and minimum number of motorcycles shipped in any order in USA (that is, PRODUCTLINE is Motorcycles, STATUS is Shipped and COUNTRY is USA)? Obtain a 95% confidence interval to estimate the number of motorcycles shipped in any order in USA. Explicitly state\and verify the assumptions to validate the choice of confidence interval you have chosen.
